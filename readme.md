This is the Creality Sonic Pad `printer.cfg` for my Ender 5 Pro. 

This config was started from the default `Ender 5 Pro ABL` config included on 
the Sonic Pad. Note that the **step_pin** and the **dir_pin** settings were 
flipped incorrectly for the X,Y,Z steppers and the extruder in the default 
config. Additionally, while it is essentially useless, this config enables the 
stock display for aesthetic purposes.  

Other hardware customizations from stock Ender 5 Pro:
- Micro Swiss All Metal Hotend
- Creality 32bit 4.2.7 mainboard 
- CR-Touch 
- Creality Sonic Pad 

My Micro Swiss all metal hotend was too long and it prevented the CR-Touch from 
activating before the nozzle would hit the print bed so I needed a custom 
bracket. The included bracket is a modified version of HellBz CR-Touch mount. 
It's a quick and dirty modification that adds a 2mm extrusion to lower the 
CR-Touch to the correct height for my printer.
